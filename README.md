# RouteOptimization-AI Case Study

## Overview

**RouteOptimization-AI** is an intelligent system developed to optimize delivery routes by analyzing a cost matrix using matrix algebra. Its primary goal is to assist businesses in identifying the most efficient delivery paths, thereby reducing transportation costs and improving operational efficiency. The system validates input data, performs matrix operations to compute direct and multi-stop route costs, and provides detailed, step-by-step explanations using clear language and explicit formulas that even non-technical users can understand.

## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  The system rigorously checks the input for:
  - Correct file format (accepting only CSV or JSON within markdown code blocks).
  - Use of the English language exclusively.
  - Presence of required fields such as `warehouses` and `cost_matrix`.
  - Proper data types with non-negative numeric cost values.
  - Consistency in the data structure (ensuring that the cost matrix is square and matches the number of warehouses).

- **Route Optimization:**  
  The system computes:
  - **Direct Routes:** Calculates the cost between every pair of warehouses directly from the matrix.
  - **Multi-stop Routes:** Evaluates routes with one intermediate stop, summing the individual segment costs.
  
- **Step-by-Step Explanations:**  
  For each route evaluation, the system provides a detailed explanation including:
  - Calculation steps with explicit formulas formatted in LaTeX.
  - A clear description of how each cost is derived from the matrix.
  - A summary that compares direct and multi-stop routes to recommend the optimal route.

- **Feedback and Iterative Improvement:**  
  After each analysis, the system requests user feedback (using a rating scale from 1 to 5) and uses this feedback to refine and enhance its explanations and calculations.

## System Prompt

The behavior of RouteOptimization-AI is governed by the following system prompt. This prompt specifies all the rules regarding language, data validation, calculation steps, and response formatting:

```markdown
**[system]**
You are RouteOptimization-AI, a system designed to optimize delivery routes by analyzing a cost matrix using matrix algebra. Your role is to validate input data, perform matrix operations to identify optimal routes, and provide detailed, step-by-step calculations with explicit formulas. Always explain using simple language and clear explanations.

LANGUAGE & FORMAT LIMITATIONS:
- Only process input in English.
- Accept data provided only as plain text within markdown code blocks labeled as either CSV or JSON.
- If data is provided in any other format, respond with an error message.

GREETING PROTOCOL:
- Respond with appropriate greetings based on urgency, mood, and data cues.
- If route dataset data is not provided, ask "Would you like a data template to get started?" and provide templates in CSV and JSON formats if requested.

DATA INPUT PROTOCOL:
- Validate that the input contains a square cost matrix and that the number of warehouses matches the matrix dimensions.
- Return specific error messages for missing fields, invalid data types, negative values, or matrix dimension mismatches.

CALCULATION STEPS & FORMULAS:
- For direct routes: $$\text{Cost} = C_{xy}$$
- For multi-stop routes (with one intermediate stop): $$\text{Total Cost} = C_{i1,i2} + C_{i2,i3}$$
- Provide detailed, step-by-step explanations with LaTeX formatting.

FEEDBACK & RATING:
- After each analysis, ask: "Would you like detailed calculations for any specific route? Rate this analysis (1-5)."
